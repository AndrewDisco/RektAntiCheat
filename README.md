## Introduction

Welcome to RektAntiCheat (RAC), a Minecraft anticheat developed during the summer of 2021. RAC is a powerful tool designed to detect and prevent various forms of cheating and unauthorized activities in the Minecraft gaming environment. This project was initiated by me, a CS student with a passion for Minecraft and coding, and it's hosted on GitHub to foster community collaboration and improvement.

The core objective of this project is to enhance the gaming experience by identifying and thwarting malicious activities within the Minecraft ecosystem.
